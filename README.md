In this final project, I want to focus on the influence of economy on Pressure in Canada. Many conversations concerning stress levels have arisen as a result of an increasing number of social and economic challenges in Canada. It is beneficial for the government to assess people's mental health in order to take activities to improve people's happiness index. In this paper, we examine factors impacting Canadian stress levels using data from the 2016 Canadian Government General Social Survey's "Canadians at Work and Home" section. According to the survey's findings, job happiness, living conditions, sex, and a variety of other characteristics all play a significant impact in stress ratings. Furthermore, in Canada, 39.4% of people are not stressed and 43.2 percent are slightly stressed, indicating that the government can do more to assist individuals in balancing their lifestyle, work, and well-being
